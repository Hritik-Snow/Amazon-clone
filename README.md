Hello to all,
It is my first project as a computer science learner.
In this project, i make a clone of a famous and so much used in online shoppin - "Amazon".
I made this with the help of HTML and CSS.
As it's my first project, I also take the help of a YouTube channel - "Apna College" and also i study HTML and CSS from this channel which was outstanding and i am not promoting this channel but yaa it is very useful for
me so i am highlighting this.
As a freasher in CS, i am very exciting to built this project but before i have to learn how this works and i learn this from channel which i talk about above and in this excitement i don't know how but i completed 
a 2-3 hr lecture of HTML and 7-8 hr lecture of CSS in just 2 days and starting working on my project next day.
And after many hours, i built this and i know it is not completed fully yet but i do work hard for this and i am also not a student of any institute.


That's it, Thank You.
